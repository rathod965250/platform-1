## 🚀 Performance

### Optimizations:
- ✅ useCallback for stable functions
- ✅ Minimal re-renders
- ✅ Debounced auto-save (on navigation)
- ✅ Efficient state updates
- ✅ Single timer interval
- ✅ Memoized calculations

### Database:
- ✅ Upsert instead of separate insert/update
- ✅ Bulk updates where possible
- ✅ Indexed queries (attempt_id, user_id)
- ✅ Single fetch for all data

---

## 💡 Key Technical Highlights

### 1. **Full-Screen API**
```typescript
document.documentElement.requestFullscreen()
document.exitFullscreen()
```

### 2. **Timer Management**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    setTimeRemaining((prev) => {
      if (prev <= 1) {
        handleAutoSubmit()
        return 0
      }
      return prev - 1
    })
  }, 1000)
  return () => clearInterval(timer)
}, [])
```

### 3. **Upsert Pattern**
```typescript
await supabase
  .from('attempt_answers')
  .upsert(answerData, { onConflict: 'attempt_id,question_id' })
```

### 4. **Score Calculation**
```typescript
const isCorrect = answer.user_answer === question.correct_answer
if (isCorrect) {
  score += question.marks
} else if (test.negative_marking) {
  score -= question.marks * 0.25
}
```
