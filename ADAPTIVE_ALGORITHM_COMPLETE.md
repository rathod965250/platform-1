# Adaptive Algorithm Implementation - Complete ✅

## Overview
The Adaptive Algorithm system provides real-time difficulty adjustment for practice mode, building student confidence through personalized question selection based on performance.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Phase 1: Database Schema
**File**: `supabase/migrations/003_adaptive_algorithm_tables.sql`
**Status**: Applied to Supabase ✅

**Tables Created:**
1. **adaptive_state** - Tracks user mastery per category
   - `mastery_score` (0-1): Current skill level
   - `current_difficulty` (easy/medium/hard): Active difficulty
   - `recent_accuracy`: Array of last 10 accuracy scores
   - `avg_time_seconds`: Running average of time per question

2. **user_metrics** - Logs every question attempt
   - Records correctness, time taken, difficulty transition
   - Links to questions, subcategories, sessions
   - Tracks mastery before/after each question

3. **session_stats** - Aggregated session performance
   - Average accuracy and time
   - Improvement rate (first 5 vs last 5 questions)
   - Topic-wise accuracy breakdown
   - Difficulty transition count

**Helper Functions:**
- `initialize_adaptive_state()` - Creates state for new user-category pairs
- `update_adaptive_state()` - Updates mastery after each question

### ✅ Phase 2: Supabase Edge Functions (All 3 Deployed)
**Status**: Deployed and Active ✅

#### 1. **adaptive-next-question**
**Endpoint**: `/functions/v1/adaptive-next-question`
**Purpose**: Core adaptive algorithm

**Features:**
- Real-time mastery score calculation (0.05 increments/decrements)
- Difficulty adjustment:
  - `mastery > 0.75` → Hard
  - `mastery < 0.35` → Easy
  - Else → Medium
- **Topic filtering**: ONLY fetches from selected subcategories
- No repeat questions within session
- Fallback to nearest difficulty if target unavailable
- Returns question + updated analytics

**Input:**
```typescript
{
  user_id: string
  category_id: string
  session_id: string
  selected_subcategories: string[]  // CRITICAL: Enforces topic scope
  answered_question_ids?: string[]
  last_question?: {
    question_id: string
    is_correct: boolean
    time_taken: number
    difficulty: string
  }
}
```

**Output:**
```typescript
{
  question: {
    id, text, type, options, difficulty, subcategory
  }
  analytics: {
    mastery_score: number

## Key Implementation Details

### Minimum Viable Metrics (All Tracked ✅)

| Category | Metric | Implementation |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Performance | Accuracy | ✅ `user_metrics.is_correct`, `session_stats.avg_accuracy` |
| Performance | Average Time | ✅ `user_metrics.time_taken_seconds`, `session_stats.avg_time_seconds` |
| Performance | Topic-Wise Accuracy | ✅ `session_stats.topic_wise_accuracy` (JSONB) |
| Performance | Mastery Score | ✅ `adaptive_state.mastery_score` (0-1) |
| Engagement | Session Duration | ✅ `session_stats.session_duration_seconds` |
| Engagement | Session Frequency | ✅ Count from `session_stats` table |
| Improvement | Accuracy Improvement | ✅ `session_stats.improvement_rate` (first 5 vs last 5) |
| Algorithm | Difficulty Transitions | ✅ `session_stats.difficulty_transitions` |
| Dashboard | Current Level & Trend | ✅ Displayed in practice interface sidebar |

### Topic Selection Enforcement

**CRITICAL**: The algorithm STRICTLY enforces topic selection:

1. **Configuration Page**: User selects subcategories
2. **Session Config**: Stored in `practice_sessions.config.selected_subcategories`
3. **Edge Function**: Filters questions using `.in('subcategory_id', selected_subcategories)`
4. **No Scope Violation**: Questions ONLY come from selected topics

**Fallback Logic:**
- If no questions at target difficulty in selected topics
- Try next difficulty level (medium → easy → hard)
- Still ONLY within selected subcategories

### Answer Checking Logic

**Process:**
1. User selects answer (A, B, C, or D)
2. Frontend calls Edge Function with answer data
3. Frontend also fetches full question from database
4. Compares selected answer with `correct_answer` field
5. Updates mastery score based on correctness
6. Fetches next question with updated difficulty

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Options stored as array vs object
- Correct answer in different formats
- Case-insensitive comparison
- Fallback to question fetch if options unclear

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Client-side filtering**: Answered questions filtered in Edge Function
2. **Efficient queries**: Single query with joins
3. **Indexed queries**: All foreign keys indexed
4. **Batched operations**: Metrics inserted in single transaction
5. **Caching**: Adaptive state fetched once per session

## User Flow

```
1. User selects category → /practice/configure/[categoryId]
   ↓
2. User selects topics (subcategories) → Clicks "Start Adaptive Practice"
   ↓
3. Session created → Redirects to /practice/adaptive/[categoryId]/start
   ↓
4. First question fetched → Displayed with metrics
   ↓
5. User answers → Immediate feedback shown
   ↓
6. Edge Function calculates new mastery → Determines next difficulty
   ↓
7. Next question fetched (from selected topics only) → Seamless transition
   ↓
8. Repeat steps 5-7 until session ends
   ↓
9. User clicks "End Session" → /practice/adaptive/[categoryId]/[sessionId]/summary
   ↓
10. Analytics calculated → Recommendations generated
   ↓
11. Summary displayed → User can practice again or return to dashboard
```

## Security & Performance

### Security
